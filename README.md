# Pong
ðŸŒ¸ || Pink Colour Pallet || ðŸŽ® || 100 Line Pygame Pong project || ðŸŒ¸

Pong a very customizable game due to it's lack of colour, animation and general scheme. 
I replicated Pong taking advantage of this factor, changing the pallet to pink and white.
A more pleasing GUI contrary to it's old grim cousin's scheme black and white.
